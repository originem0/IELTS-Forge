## Self-Correcting Rules Engine

When the user corrects an implementation or workflow, fix the current issue and add a concise reusable rule below when appropriate. Avoid duplicate rules and do not retain temporary requests as permanent rules.

## Learned Rules

<!-- New reusable rules are appended below this line. Do not edit above this section. -->
[UI] Correction reviews use compact vertical comparisons with aligned actions; notebook review controls stay in a small toolbar, with one practice action per note and no repeated status prose or nested card shells.
[UI] Notebook composers must show every field and save control without panel scrolling; size the adjacent library to the form and scroll only library content, keeping its title and filters visible. Stacked layouts use a separately bounded library.
[ARCH] Collect writing and speaking mistakes individually from reviewed, source-matched corrections; practice the saved original before revealing its reference correction and schedule reviews by self-assessed performance, without whole-answer imports or mandatory new scenarios.
[UI] Pausing a writing practice timer must make the answer read-only until timing resumes, with a visible pause notice and the draft preserved.
[UI] A single recording workflow must produce synchronized audio and transcript with one capture control and one durable save operation; history must restore both outputs.
[UI] Changing a task type must update its dependent default settings; loading a saved record must preserve that record's explicit settings.
[WORKFLOW] Verify the user's running copy and visible page after fixing a local app; changes only present in a development or candidate package do not fix an older running copy. Preserve unsaved work before refreshing.
[CODE] Keep browser speech transcripts verbatim; handle ASR punctuation, capitalization, and uncertain sentence boundaries in AI review instructions rather than automatic local formatting.
[WORKFLOW] Build into a fresh staging directory and never recursively clean the distribution root; users may run extracted packages and store data there.
[UI] Use visible single-selection buttons instead of dropdowns for short notebook category lists, matching the adjacent filter controls and preserving an accessible selected state.
[ARCH] User-requested API credential persistence must use local OS-backed encryption, support explicit removal, and stay outside learning backups and distribution packages.
[UI] Render AI feedback as sanitized Markdown in both live results and saved history, keeping the original text in storage and bundling rendering dependencies for offline use.
[UI] Practice history should lead with the specific question topic, with task type as secondary metadata; reference the user's existing local review layouts before redesigning report displays.
[UI] Review reports belong on a dedicated navigable page, not a modal; show exact model-provided corrections inline in the original text and keep headers in normal flow so they do not obscure content.
[WORKFLOW] When the user supplies an app or thread as a UI reference, reuse its presentation and interaction flow without importing its grading rules, personal data, or prompts unless explicitly requested.
[UI] Inline annotations and their explanation cards must support navigation in both directions, restoring focus and highlighting the exact source passage on return.
[UI] Keep answer editing separate from saved report presentation; hide conversational preambles and avoid repeating corrections already displayed as annotation cards.
[UI] Place compact delete controls inside the top-right of history and notebook cards, reserving title space and overriding generic button height so controls never overlap text or stretch with the header.
[CODE] Match review quotations across typographic hyphen, quote and whitespace variants using offsets into the untouched source; reject ambiguous or lexically different matches rather than inventing a location.
[WORKFLOW] Pin CI runner families to required compiler generations and verify the entire remote build and artifact upload before calling CI fixed; a local build does not validate a moving hosted image.
[UI] When one bundled transcription engine is the supported path, expose one record-stop-transcribe flow and do not retain a competing browser transcription mode.
[UI] A no-limit writing session uses a visible count-up timer instead of an infinity placeholder or a disabled timing action.
[ARCH] Study plans must cap new output volume and prioritize review, reusable-language study, and rewriting as explicit tasks.
[CODE] Inline writing corrections are reserved for definite grammar, spelling, or mechanical errors; stylistic improvements must appear separately and must not mark the source as wrong.
[UI] Keep action groups and media controls visibly separated from adjacent text areas, previews, and helper text at every responsive width.
[WORKFLOW] Writing and speaking practice records autosave after meaningful edits and after transcription; do not require a separate save button before review or navigation.
[ARCH] Writing prompt images go to a vision-capable model for extraction without the essay; the user reviews and edits the extracted information before explicitly confirming text-only grading by the configured text model. Persist extraction and the confirmed review snapshot, invalidate extraction when the prompt or images change, and never pretend the text grader saw the image.
[WORKFLOW] Windows release packages must include a visible stop-service executable that can end leftover launcher processes before users delete or replace an extracted version.
[CODE] Normalize AI output into fixed provider-neutral schemas and silently discard unrecognized fields or items instead of stringifying or rendering malformed content — prevents provider response drift from breaking the UI.
[UI] All writing Task 1 or Task 2 and speaking reports use the same core section order and card shell: original question, score and subscores, overall feedback, answer and annotations, exact corrections, optional improvements, model answer, and reusable language; only media-specific evidence may differ.
[UI] IELTS speaking practice must send the full question and explicit Part to AI; Part 2 runs a one-minute unrecorded preparation countdown followed by a two-minute recorded answer.
[UI] Timed writing may use a distraction-free mode with collapsible global navigation and simultaneous access to prompt, timer, and answer area; speaking practice must remain in its normal recording-and-transcript layout without a focus mode.
[ARCH] Personal language-bank generation is user-triggered, rebuilds from existing and newer saved practice text without audio or images, validates structured JSON, and persists the result locally.
[UI] Focus mode must hide controls that enter focus mode and group its exit action with the writing timer controls using the same button system, without overlapping or duplicating actions.
[UI] Potentially long generated libraries use separate content tabs and a master-detail card layout that expands only the selected item.
[UI] Input and generated-result panels with strongly unequal content heights should stack at full width instead of leaving an empty column beside a long report.
[UI] Writing uses distinct setup, timed-session, and report states; reviewed writing or speaking history opens the report directly with no separate open-report button, while rewriting creates a new attempt from the report action.
[UI] Sidebar collapse controls use only a small arrow at the top-right, with no border, fill, shadow, or rounded container, and reserve enough top spacing that the arrow never overlaps the collapsed brand icon.
[ARCH] Personal language-bank refreshes are append-only: process complete new or changed records in bounded batches, merge summaries hierarchically, and preserve every previously saved card and expression.
[UI] A focused writing session shows only the prompt, answer, timer, pause or continue, and finish controls; hide review, AI, notebook, deletion, and other post-answer actions until focus ends.
[UI] Score overviews must reserve the full remaining width for criteria evidence so long tables never collapse into a narrow column beside empty space.
[ARCH] Prefer a small, stage-based interaction flow with one obvious primary action per state; avoid special modes, duplicate controls, and optional branches unless they materially improve the user's task.
[CODE] IELTS writing word counts include letter-based English words only; standalone numbers and punctuation do not increase the count, while contractions and hyphenated words remain single words.
[UI] Writing and speaking score summaries use a compact version of the legacy review visual language: a restrained serif overall-score card beside a two-column criterion grid, sized so following feedback begins near the first viewport; never a dense evidence table.
[UI] Writing and speaking use the same left-side practice-history pattern with visible filters; all-results mode groups writing by Task 1 or Task 2 and speaking by Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, or free practice.
[UI] Personal writing language is grouped into familiar exam domains plus a separate general-expression category; show only a small daily rotating memory set while preserving every saved expression locally.
[UI] Writing and speaking module routes open a compact overview with today's plan, memory prompts, and history; only the explicit New Practice action opens the setup or recording workspace.
[UI] The home dashboard shows compact writing and speaking completion summaries with optional details; module-specific daily plan instructions belong on the writing and speaking overview pages.
[UI] Review score cards reserve large serif typography for numeric bands only; non-numeric limitations such as unavailable pronunciation scoring use compact status text, and score ranges must stay on one line.
[UI] Personal writing-language entries display a concise Chinese translation beneath the English expression; legacy entries without translations remain intact and are enriched on the next user-triggered language-bank update.
[WORKFLOW] Every writing or speaking UI correction requires an audit of the equivalent state, control, and layout in the other practice module; apply shared fixes to both when the issue is common.
[UI] Review-page sections use one consistent white rounded-card shell matching the original-and-annotations panel; keep only necessary internal emphasis instead of giving each report section a different outer style.
[UI] Question images in review pages use compact contained previews with an explicit magnifier that opens a full-screen lightbox; never let the inline image dominate an entire viewport.
[UI] Review reports are read by ordinary vertical scrolling and do not show a redundant chapter-navigation button row.
[CODE] Review snapshots fall back field by field to the original practice record when legacy snapshots omit the prompt, images, type, or answer; never let one partial snapshot hide a preserved original question.
[ARCH] Personal language-bank updates must merge semantically similar speaking themes into the existing card and append only unique material; title wording differences must never create duplicate topics.
[ARCH] Personal language-bank extraction must process and validate writing and speaking independently; written arguments and academic phrases must never be accepted as speaking-personal material.
[UI] AI-generated review sections must render through stable client-side component structures; do not let model-selected Markdown lists or tables change the same section's UI between reports.
[ARCH] Track AI-processed practice inputs by stable content fingerprints rather than timestamps; language-card deletion must persist to disk and clear only its source records' processed markers so they can be generated again.
[ARCH] Persist every practice, plan, language item, deletion, and AI-processing marker through the bound local-disk API; browser-only caches must never be the source of truth.
[UI] Speaking reusable-topic chips use concise Chinese labels consistently; normalize legacy English topic labels and require future AI output to follow the same language.
[CODE] IELTS review prompts must carry the exact Writing Task or Speaking Part, its applicable format and length requirements, and the relevant official public band-descriptor dimensions; never score every task with one generic rubric.
[ARCH] The local launcher must bind only to a free loopback port selected atomically by the operating system, so an occupied port can never prevent startup or connect a new launch to an older process.
[UI] The personal language-bank page must not display accumulated AI summary prose or source-count metadata as a permanent card; lead directly into the speaking and writing material tabs, reserving status UI for active work or errors.
[UI] Speaking expressions and answer frames use the same bilingual hierarchy as writing language: English on the primary line and its concise Chinese translation below, including normalized legacy entries.
[WORKFLOW] Keep the README screenshot gallery to one or two representative, polished product views; remove obsolete or anomalous screenshots instead of documenting every page.
[WORKFLOW] A user-triggered AI action may automatically retry one provider-format failure; never require repeated clicks, and never overwrite saved data until a fully validated response succeeds.
[WORKFLOW] The supported distribution targets Windows; preserve its launcher, DPAPI storage, Whisper build, package contents and behavior, and require the full Windows CI job to succeed before publishing a release.
[UI] Question-bank import belongs on a visible, guided page linked from navigation and empty practice states. Accept a ready ZIP or folder, identify question files and pair attachments automatically, skip audit documents, and show a clear preview and next practice action.
[UI] Use restrained macOS-style chrome with the existing palette, compact toolbars and content-first practice layouts; hide practice history while answering, keep passage notes optional, and place the IELTS guide and study-plan entry on the home page instead of adding sidebar destinations.
[ARCH] Text and optional image AI connections each offer relay, OpenAI, Claude, GLM, Gemini, Grok and DeepSeek choices with model discovery; keep endpoint protocol separate from model vendor and encrypt each connection's credentials independently within local configuration.
[ARCH] Without an independent image connection, image tasks use the exact configured text endpoint and model; verify image understanding before sending practice material, preserve real image inputs, and never silently strip images or switch models.
[ARCH] Only writing and speaking accept in-app manual question authoring saved to the reusable "我的题目" bank pack (re-POSTed as a new immutable version per save; Task 1 figures are uploaded to library media and referenced by content id; authored units are retired by a per-unit hidden flag — filtered from selection but kept for history and un-hiding — never by deleting the immutable pack). Reading and listening are not hand-authored; found exam audio without digital questions imports as a listen-only resource — a listening unit with audio and a machine transcript but no question groups, played with the transcript revealed on demand and never auto-graded — rather than discarded or faked into a scored test.
[WORKFLOW] Source-quality constraints on requested question-bank additions apply to future sourcing; do not remove existing material unless the user explicitly requests that cleanup.
[ARCH] Question provenance must distinguish exam, publication, season, creation and collection years; label authentic exams, reported recalls, generated practice and unverified practice separately, retain evidence links, and never infer authenticity or an exam year from a download date or legacy source status.
[WORKFLOW] Curated writing banks must check Task 1 Academic, Task 1 General and Task 2 coverage separately; General letters retain the full situation, all three bullet points and any required salutation.
[WORKFLOW] Never leave the user's installed launcher running with browser opening suppressed after acceptance; hand off a visible working page or shut down the test-owned process, and verify a normal double-click launch before declaring the update complete.
